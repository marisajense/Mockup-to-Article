1. I haven’t quite learned anything new, but this has been a great refresher and good practice to use some elements that I’ve never had the chance to use before!
2. It’s all been relatively “easy”
3. At first, trying to remember paths
4. I used google (MDN and W3Schools) a few times during this practice!
